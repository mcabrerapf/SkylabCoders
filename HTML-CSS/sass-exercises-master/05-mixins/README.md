#Â SASS mixins

- Create a mixins partial in your base directory and `@import` it in your main `.scss` file.
- Create a `@mixin` for scaled transformations with a required scale amount argument. Include common vendor prefixes. (`transform: scale(1.1)`)
- Look for other combinations of repeated styles or complexities that could be abstracted.
